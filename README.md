Third project, Dragon Fruit Frolic is a mapping app for use by the cohort to plan and save memories during our travel. 
It was an attempt to make something more practical and straightforward than my prior projects something that could me more useful and more completable. 
I feel, in retrospect that this was a mistake in a few aspects. 

First, in doing something more practical and straightforward it was not sufficiently differentiated from many other existing products and projects. 
I ignored my unique approach to the world to try an make something more tangibly useful than I had before but it became even more useless in its similarity to things that were already existing and technically superior. 

Secondly, just because something is more clear cut does not mean I'll be able to actually finish it to match my vision, and once I do finish what I initially envision that vision will change and morph, and the benchmarks for analysis will change.
It is good to figure out how doable something is but segmentally, as nothing is ever complete. 

Positives, I am glad I worked some with mapping and geocoding. I have had an idea for some map based functionality I feel is sorely missing from the world and now may have at least some understanding of what it will take to implement.
I think this future mapping idea might have been what pushed me in this direction.

The code itself I ran into a bunch of issues. Initially getting the dataflow properly store the information in the server first then retrieve it for the map, rather than going directly to the map on the client side. 
I set it up working initially without too much issue, but then when adding the geocoding it did not integrate properly and figuring that out then correcting it took quite a while.

The next issue were image files. The file size initially seemed an issue and it was attempted to be solved via a DFS code piece. This seemed to work initially but when the code was transferred from my system to glitch there was an issue.
It seems as though the image files were being stored on a folder in my server locally, by the conclusion of the project I had not yet been able to get the folder into the glitch file arrangement so the image storage functionality working.
At least not beyond my internal system. 

Finally I added the aesthetics for the dragon fruits and the kool-aid man dragonfruit smashing through the Berlin wall, which was the item with the most positive feedback.

Looking back I should have continued either project 1 or project 2. 
Project 1 I might have used ML5 to add some kind of hand mostion or face masking function to the Met API i was working with.
Project 2 I would have tried to add a therapeutic or advisory fine tuning to the gpt interactor - though this did not seem to add an additional library as was part of the assigned task for item 3, and I could not figure out how to incorporate one.

Certainly have come a remarkably long way since september when I knew absolutely none of this stuff. But that does not make me feel like I produced a sufficient thing.
